## Technologies Used
 This app was built using javascript, javascript xml, json, node, express, css, and html.

## Challenges
I struggled a lot with setting and debugging my Default layout, At times I tried to do inline styling to work around it but ultimately used both. Right now my CSS styling is on the minimal side. With more time, I would style my page to be closer to the model sites I chose, restyle my form buttons, and play around more with my use of grid vs. flexbox for example adding more space between products.


## Future Developments

Cart Feature: 
 In the future I'd like to add a View Cart component and add to cart button to the project, so the show view could redirect to a page that displays all items queued for purchase. 

Product Categories: 
 I would also add two more categories of products similar to the "fruits/veggies/meats" routes that we created, I would have teas, teapots, and accessories each displaying seperate indexes of products that route to their own show/new/edit views.
