#Future Developments

Cart Feature
 In the future I'd like to add a View Cart component and add to cart button to the project, so the show view could redirect to a page that displays all items queued for purchase. 

Product Categories
 I would also add two more categories of products similar to the "fruits/veggies/meats" routes that we created, I would have teas, teapots, and accessories each displaying seperate indexes of products that route to their own show/new/edit views.
